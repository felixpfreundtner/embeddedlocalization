<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Implementation usable for Direction of Arrival (DoA) classification</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The firmware allows to classify the direction of arrival (DoA) of a spoken utterance by exploiting the sound reflection pattern of the microcontroller board and the surrounding area.
We trained for this task a tiny convolutional neural network (CNN). For training we used the CMU speech recording database convolved with measured impulse responses of the shown room for 45Â° steps in the horizontal plane. We provide pre-trained networks and IPython Code to train your own tinyML network.

The recording can be started on the B-L475E-IOT01A Discovery kit by pressing the USER button.
The user has then 3 seconds time to formulate the utterance. After it the DoA prediction is performed.
The network implementation consumes at prediction 18KB flash, 26KB Ram and 59mW power.
After perfoming the prediction the microcontroller prints the prediction probability for each of the 8 horizontal incidence angles over UART.
